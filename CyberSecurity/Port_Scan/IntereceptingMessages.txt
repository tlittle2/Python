In order to find the open port with the secret message, I performed the following process:

1. Started the docker program provided by Professor Drawert

2. I then ran my port-scan.py program and saw that the docker program ran on the ip 152.18.69.107
	a. I then changed my host variable in port-scan.py program to that host ip. 
	b. I also kept changed my port range until a connected port was found after finding out that 
		none of the ports in the range 1-1023 yielded a message.

3. Upon finding this port, I 
	a. ran the command docker run -it briandrawert/csci_security_spy_lab and input the port 1234
	b. Simulatenously, I ran wireshark to have a capture filter of murphy.cs.unca.edu, and set the display filter for ip.dst == 152.18.69.107 || ip.src == 152.18.69.107
		i. This basically says while looking at murphy.cs.unca.edu, look at the source and destination ports that are for this ip address, which happens to be the ip address for murphy.cs.unca.edu
	c. In the 10th packet that I captured, the message was intercepted and said the following:
		i. Message 1: From: Dr. Evil Message: Let's just do what we always do. Hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage. Yeah? Good! Gentlemen, it has come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead and we hold the world ransom for... ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
